⚠️ Known Issue

NOTE:
We are aware of a bug where the player sometimes fails to rotate properly—this issue occurs inconsistently, about half the time.

If you experience this bug, please try plugging in a controller, even if you're using keyboard and mouse.

We recommend a minimum of 3 players, although 2 players are supported. Through playtesting, we identified what appears to be a workaround, but we were unable to implement a proper fix before the submission deadline.

From our understanding, Unity may inconsistently register inputs or assign them to the wrong player index, especially when no controllers are connected. This can prevent rotation from being processed correctly. Plugging in a controller appears to "force" Unity to remap inputs, which often resolves the rotation issue temporarily.
