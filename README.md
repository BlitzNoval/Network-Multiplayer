⚠️ Known Issue
NOTE:
We are aware of a bug where the issue occurs inconsistently - about half the time. If you encounter this bug, please try plugging in a controller.

We recommend a minimum of 3 players, although 2 players do work. Through playtesting, we identified what appears to be a workaround, but we were unable to implement a proper fix before the submission deadline.

From our understanding, Unity may inconsistently register certain controllers or assign them to the wrong player. This can result in input working only intermittently or failing entirely—unless a controller is plugged in, which seems to "force" Unity to remap the inputs correctly.
